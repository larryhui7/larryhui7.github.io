Here you will find some cool projects, or not so cool projects, that I have built, or am still working on over the years! Some are more theoretical and others are hands-on! They are sorted by chronological order, so the ones at the top are more recent!

**Current Project: Modular Analog Synthesizer**

As a pianist, I realized there was no better way to learn than by tinkering with electronics to learn sound design! I am building a modular analog synthesizer with a voltage-controlled oscillator/amplifier (VCO/VCA), a resonant diode-ladder filter shaped by attack-release envelopes, and driving it with an arpeggiator in Ableton, routed through a Keystep for MIDI to CV conversion.

Currently, I need to figure out how to calibrate the VCO to track to 1 volt/octave reliably. I suspect by implementing trimmer potentiometers to separately tune the range and the precise pitch, and do spectrum analysis in Ableton, and refining the exponential-converter stage, it will be posssible to reach stable tuning across several octaves.

Thanks to Moritz Klein, this project is currently teaching me: analog circuits at a deeper capacity, and that synthesis is effectively real-time signal shaping expressed musically. Seeing music as a control problem and controls as a creative medium changed how I think about engineering, deepening my appreciation for electronics, music, and controls.
