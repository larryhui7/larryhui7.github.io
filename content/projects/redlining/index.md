## Overview

This digital humanities project examines the intersection of urban policy and socio-environmental vulnerability within the contiguous United States. We explore the history and destructive legacies of redlining, its everlasting effects, and much more through interactive visualizations and narrative analysis.

**Case Study Cities:**
- Oakland, California
- Detroit, Michigan
- New Orleans, Louisiana

---

## Project Navigation

This project includes several interconnected components:

1. **Interactive Timeline** — Trace salient events that shaped urban inequality within our case study cities
2. **Narrative Analysis** — Text and images unpack the structural impacts of redlining in greater detail
3. **Interactive Visualizations** — Spatio-temporal insights into redlining and infrastructure changes
4. **Data Critique** — Critical examination of our data sources and methodologies

## What is Redlining?

Redlining refers to the discriminatory practice of denying or limiting financial services, particularly mortgages and insurance, to residents of certain neighborhoods based on their racial or ethnic composition. The term originated from the color-coded maps created by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) in the 1930s, where "hazardous" neighborhoods—typically those with Black, immigrant, or low-income residents—were outlined in red.

### Historical Context

The Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), established in 1933 as part of the New Deal, created "Residential Security Maps" for over 200 cities. These maps assigned grades to neighborhoods:

| Grade | Color | Description |
|:-----:|:-----:|:------------|
| A | Green | "Best" — New, homogeneous, in-demand areas |
| B | Blue | "Still Desirable" — Completely developed, stable |
| C | Yellow | "Definitely Declining" — Aging, infiltration of lower-grade population |
| D | Red | "Hazardous" — Detrimental influences, undesirable population |

These classifications institutionalized racial segregation and created lasting patterns of disinvestment that persist today.

## Case Study: Oakland, California

Oakland's redlining history demonstrates how discriminatory housing policies shaped the city's development and continue to influence socio-environmental outcomes today.

### Key Findings

- Historically redlined neighborhoods in West and East Oakland continue to experience:
  - Higher rates of environmental pollution exposure
  - Fewer green spaces and urban tree canopy
  - Greater vulnerability to climate-related hazards
  - Lower property values and reduced access to capital

### Infrastructure Legacy

The construction of major highways through Oakland's redlined neighborhoods in the 1950s-60s further entrenched patterns of segregation and environmental injustice, displacing thousands of residents and creating lasting barriers to neighborhood connectivity.

---

## Case Study: Detroit, Michigan

Detroit's experience with redlining illustrates the compound effects of discriminatory lending, deindustrialization, and environmental degradation.

### Key Findings

- Redlined areas in Detroit show strong correlations with:
  - Industrial contamination and brownfield sites
  - Lead exposure risks from aging housing stock
  - Reduced access to essential services
  - Population decline and vacancy rates

### Environmental Justice Implications

The concentration of polluting industries in historically redlined neighborhoods created a pattern of environmental racism that persists today, with communities of color bearing disproportionate exposure to toxic hazards.

---

## Case Study: New Orleans, Louisiana

New Orleans provides a critical case study for understanding how redlining intersects with climate vulnerability and disaster resilience.

### Key Findings

- Hurricane Katrina (2005) disproportionately impacted historically redlined neighborhoods
- Recovery and reconstruction investments flowed unevenly across the city
- Flood risk correlates strongly with historical HOLC grades
- Green infrastructure investments remain concentrated in historically "green" graded areas

### Climate Resilience

The intersection of historical disinvestment and climate vulnerability creates compound risks for communities in formerly redlined areas, highlighting the need for equity-centered climate adaptation strategies.

---

## Visualizations

Our interactive maps and visualizations provide spatio-temporal insights into redlining and its ripple effects across geographies.

### Interactive Maps

The project features several interactive mapping tools:

1. **Historical HOLC Maps** — Original redlining maps overlaid with modern boundaries
2. **Environmental Justice Indicators** — Pollution exposure, green space access, heat vulnerability
3. **Infrastructure Timeline** — Major infrastructure projects and their relationship to redlined areas
4. **Demographic Shifts** — Population and demographic changes over time

### Data Layers

Our visualizations incorporate multiple data sources:
- HOLC "Residential Security" maps (1930s)
- US Census data (historical and contemporary)
- EPA environmental justice screening data
- Urban tree canopy and green space inventories
- Climate vulnerability assessments

## Methodology

### Data Sources

| Source | Description | Time Period |
|:-------|:------------|:------------|
| Mapping Inequality Project | Digitized HOLC maps | 1930s |
| US Census Bureau | Demographic and housing data | 1940-2020 |
| EPA EJSCREEN | Environmental justice indicators | Contemporary |
| FEMA | Flood risk and disaster data | Various |
| Local government open data | Infrastructure, permits, land use | Various |

### Analytical Approach

1. **Spatial Analysis** — GIS-based overlay of historical redlining boundaries with contemporary indicators
2. **Statistical Correlation** — Quantitative analysis of relationships between HOLC grades and outcomes
3. **Narrative Research** — Qualitative analysis of archival documents and oral histories
4. **Comparative Case Study** — Cross-city analysis to identify patterns and variations

---

## Data Critique

### Limitations

- **Historical Map Accuracy** — HOLC maps represent a snapshot in time and may not capture all discriminatory practices
- **Boundary Stability** — Neighborhood boundaries have shifted over time, complicating direct comparisons
- **Causation vs. Correlation** — While we observe strong correlations, establishing direct causation is methodologically challenging
- **Data Gaps** — Some historical data, particularly for marginalized communities, is incomplete or missing

### Ethical Considerations

- Visualization of sensitive historical data requires careful contextualization
- Avoiding deficit-based narratives that pathologize affected communities
- Centering community voices and experiences alongside quantitative data
- Acknowledging the ongoing impacts of these policies on living communities

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Lasting Legacy** — The effects of redlining persist nearly a century later, shaping contemporary patterns of wealth, health, and environmental quality

2. **Compound Vulnerabilities** — Historical disinvestment intersects with climate change to create compound risks for affected communities

3. **Infrastructure as Policy** — Transportation and infrastructure investments reinforced and extended patterns of segregation

4. **Data as Evidence** — Digital humanities methods can make visible the spatial dimensions of historical injustice

5. **Implications for Policy** — Equity-focused investment strategies must account for historical patterns of discrimination
