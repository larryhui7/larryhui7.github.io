This section is mainly dedicated to the <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid maroon; padding-bottom: 1px;">classes</span> I have taken throughout my time at college at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) and my year abroad at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). Certain projects for classes I have done can be found under the project tab so check those out!
